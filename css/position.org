CSS *position* property is used to specify the type of position. 
It can have values like *static*, *relative*, *fixed*, *absolute* or *sticky* 
And are positioned by using properties like  *top*, *bottom*, *left*, and *right* 
These will only work if *position* property is set.

1) *position: static;*

  Elements with *position: static;* are always positioned according to the normal flow of the page. 
  HTML elements are by default *static* in position and is not effected by the *top*, *bottom*, *left*, and *right* 
  properties

2) *position: relative;*

  Elements with *position: relative;* are always positioned relative to its normal position.
  *top*, *bottom*, *left*, and *right* properties can be used to positioned the elements accordingly from its normal position.
  Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

3) *position: fixed;*

  Elements with *position: fixed;* are always positioned relative to th e viewport, 
  which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.
  *top*, *bottom*, *left*, and *right* properties can be used to positioned the elements accordingly.
  A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.

4) *position: absolute;*

  Elements with *position: fixed;* are always positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (
  instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed). If an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, 
  it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.

5) *position: sticky;*

  Elements with *position: fixed;* are always positioned based on the user's scroll position.
  A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative 
  until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).


Positioning elements can sometimes end up overlapping other elements,
CSS *z-index* property specifies the stack order of an element which places the elements on top or bottom

NOTE -

*z-index* can have negative values
